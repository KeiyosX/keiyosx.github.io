			Born in 1998, I was a little fat baby but due to medical complications, I lost a lot of weight. I went to Ashmole Primary School. I was no popular kid but I got by as your normal average everyday nerd who obsessed over video games (Sonic the Hedgehog in particular). From this age, I already knew what I wanted to become: I was going to become someone who can and is going to create awesome video games for people to enjoy. <br><br>

			Then I went to Lambeth Academy in Clapham for Secondary school. It was at this point where things got a lot more difficult. With no friends from primary school going there as well. I was pretty much alone for Y7 and Y8. Being a nerd, this means I got bullied a lot too but I never let it get to me (I'm just gonna creep) as I still had my end goal in mind and wanted to strive towards it. Around year 10 my work ethic strated to slip since... I dunno, puberty? While My A Grade GCSE Maths Grade was achieved in Year 10, this was my only A grade. I got mostly C's which I'm not mad about. However, this is the time my self esteem began to improve as I shrugged of my troubles and tried to enjoy each day as it came; tommorow's problems were for tommorow's me. I also made a proper group of friends instead of only talking to people in class and being a loner and break and lunch time. <br><br>

			A level's though? Year 12 and 13 was great in terms of hanging out with friends but school work? It was not the one. A2 did go better in terms of maths, I got a B in AS maths and D* in Business sub Diploma. Despite these grades, I don't struggle with explaining any of the course content so it's not a true reflection of my ability. I also begin to see teachers in a different way from before. As the class sizes were much smaller, they became more like mentors who actually wanted you to suceed. That was nice.<br><br>

			During my time in sixth form, I'd heard about the Step Forward program which caught my attention when I heard there'd be a 9K salary (and also work experience there may have been something about that). I successfully applied and now I'm a Service Desk Analyst at Tandem Bank. Everyone there is pretty chill and the work atmosphere and culture is always lively.<br>
